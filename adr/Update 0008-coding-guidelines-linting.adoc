## Context and Problem Statement

The `eclipse-format.xml` ruleset defines a clear intent for how code should be structured and formatted. However, without proper enforcement or suggestion mechanisms, these guidelines often go unheeded. Tools like ESLint and Ktlint address recurring patterns, but their rules and conventions go beyond cosmetic issues—they also ensure smooth Git operations across multiple systems. For example:

- Consistent line endings (`line-endings=lf`).
- Avoiding `unused/wildcard` imports, which are critical for precompile optimization.

One of the main goals of this project is to prioritize performance at all costs. However, this high expectation comes with trade-offs, as everything is interrelated and impacts the entire workflow.

The most common solution is to introduce a linter framework—in this case, Checkstyle, as it is widely used and well-established. This approach aligns with the `convention-over-configuration` principle, improving onboarding for new developers and reducing recurring costs associated with explaining coding guidelines or configuring plugins.

For example, rules like `AvoidStarImport` and `UnusedImports` address simple but critical issues that are hard to check manually. These rules can serve as a foundation for migrating from optional formatting to consistently enforced formatting.

## Decision

What is the change being proposed or implemented?

- Automate the enforcement of coding guidelines to reduce friction and effort in PR reviews.
- Ensure a consistent level of code quality.
- Prevent recurring issues from the past.

## Consequences

- **Fewer Errors and Repetition in PR Communication**: Less time spent manually communicating, applying, and observing guidelines.
- **Increased Build Time**: Slightly longer build times due to linting checks.
- **Ease of Development**: Easier to maintain consistent code quality and onboard new developers. Checkstyle works out of the box, requiring no initial setup, and runs with the build. It also offers a CLI mode to fix misaligned code, reducing costs further through automation.
