## Context and Problem Statement

The [Quarkus Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#formatting) outline formatting requirements, yet without enforcement, adherence is inconsistent. Based on experience, formatting is rarely followed unless automated.

Currently, formatting requires manual effort and discussion in PRs. Automating this process eliminates friction, ensuring consistency across the codebase. The [`eclipse-format.xml`](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/main/independent-projects/ide-config/src/main/resources/eclipse-format.xml) ruleset provides a structure, but without enforcement, it is often overlooked. Tools like ESLint and Ktlint solve similar issues, addressing both aesthetic and functional concerns such as:

- Enforcing consistent line endings (`line-endings=lf`).
- Preventing `unused/wildcard` imports, which impact precompile optimization.

To maintain performance while minimizing workflow disruption, adopting a linter framework—such as Checkstyle—ensures consistency with minimal configuration. This aligns with the `convention-over-configuration` approach, streamlining onboarding and reducing time spent discussing formatting issues.

Rules like `AvoidStarImport` and `UnusedImports` provide a foundation for moving from optional to mandatory formatting enforcement.

## Decision

### Proposed Changes
- Enforce coding guidelines automatically to improve PR efficiency.
- Maintain consistent code quality.
- Eliminate recurring formatting issues.

---

## Consequences

- **Less PR Overhead**: Reduces discussions and manual formatting.
- **Minimal Build Time Impact**: Slight increase due to linting.
- **Improved Development Experience**:
  - Checkstyle requires no setup and integrates with the build.
  - CLI support for auto-fixing misaligned code, further reducing manual effort.
